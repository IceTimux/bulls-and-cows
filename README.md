Bulls and Cows (also known as Cows and Bulls or Pigs and Bulls) is an old code-breaking mind or paper and pencil game for two or more players, predating the commercially marketed board game Mastermind.

It is a game that may date back a century or more which uses numbers or words. It is played by two opponents. Here your oponent is the computer.
